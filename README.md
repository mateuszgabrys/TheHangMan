Why do I code?

Coding is now used in almost every area of life and our realiance on technology is only growing. 
Programming skills are  the future and I would like to be an active part of this world. When you know how to code - the possibilities are endless.

Besides, no one wants to hear me play keyboards, so I am trying my hand at writing code on a computer keyboard :)
